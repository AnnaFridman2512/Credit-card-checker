#Credit Card Checker
##Project Goals
Context: The company that you work for suspects that credit card distributors have been mailing out cards that have invalid numbers.
In this project, you have the role of a clerk who checks if credit cards are valid.
Every other clerk currently checks using pencil and paper, 
but youâ€™ll be optimizing the verification process using your knowledge of functions and loops to handle multiple credit cards at a time. 
Unlike the other clerks, you can spend the rest of your time relaxing!

###validateCred()
The role is to return true when an array contains digits of a valid credit card number and false when it is invalid.
This function should NOT mutate the values of the original array.

###findInvalidCards()
The role is to check through the nested array for which numbers are invalid, and return another nested array of invalid cards.

###idInvalidCardCompanies()
The role is to to identify the credit card companies that have possibly issued these faulty numbers.
